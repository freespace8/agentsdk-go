# Getting Started

1. Install Go 1.23 or newer.
2. Clone this repository and run `go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourusername` if needed.
3. Execute `make build` to confirm the scaffold compiles.
4. Explore `examples/` to see how the agent runtime is expected to be wired.

Document all deviations from `docs/architecture.md` as you begin implementing features.
